# Image Reconstruction from a Sinogram

Given a sinogram, use back-projection and filtering to find an accurate representation of the original image. A detailed report on how the code functions is available in the 'Image Reconstruction from a Sinogram' PDF file.

## project1.py

Project1.py is the main implementation. It imports from the numpy, imutils, skimage and scipy modules and has methods to transform an image to a sinogram, translate an image from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, filter an image using a ramp filter, translate an image from the frequency domain to the spatial domain and construct a laminogram using back-projection.
